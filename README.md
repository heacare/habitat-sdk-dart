# Habitat SDK

[![Dart CI](https://github.com/heacare/habitat-sdk-dart/actions/workflows/dart.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/heacare/habitat-sdk-dart/actions/workflows/dart.yml)

## Introduction

This is the reference implementaion of Habitat, an open, composable data network built on top of DWN, in Dart. Habitat and DWN both are still in a draft state so things may change rapidly.

This repository includes an implementation of DWN in Dart with a similar API as the [reference implementation](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-sdk-js). We are planning to break it out when the DWN specification is stable.
