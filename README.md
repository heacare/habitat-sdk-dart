# Habitat SDK

## Introduction

This is the reference implementaion of Habitat, an open, composable data network built on top of DWN, in Dart. Habitat and DWN both are still in a draft state so things may change rapidly.

This repository includes an implementation of DWN in Dart with a similar API as the [reference implementation](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-sdk-js). We are planning to break it out when the DWN specification is stable.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Preliminary DWN SDK in Dart
- [ ] Habitat SDK in Dart
- [ ] Flutter Habitat SDK in Dart
- [ ] Produce JS builds for use in React Native
